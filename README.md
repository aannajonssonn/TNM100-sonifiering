## Setup instructions for proper server
* Make sure node.js is installed on the machine
* Make sure SuperCollider is installed on the machine
* Open the project folder in VS Code
* Open terminal in VS Code, make sure you are in the project folder and run:
```PowerShell
node .\app.js
```
* The server should now be accessible at [http://127.0.0.1:3000/](http://127.0.0.1:3000/)
* You might get an error that the Node server cannot find Supercollider. To solve this you have to move the desired file to the path the server requests.
